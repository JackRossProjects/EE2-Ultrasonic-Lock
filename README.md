# Electrical Engineering Project #2 - Ultrasonic Lock

For this project I wanted to make a distance sensing lock.

I used an ultrasonic distance sensor and a 9g servo for the main functionality. If you put something infront of the ultrasonic distance sensor, the servo (which will be connected to the lock) turns 180 degrees and unlocks the door or secret compartment.
