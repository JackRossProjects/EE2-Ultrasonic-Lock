# Electrical Engineering Project #2 - Ultrasonic Lock

For this project I wanted to make a distance sensing lock.

I used an ultrasonic distance sensor and a 9g servo for the main functionality. If you put something infront of the ultrasonic distance sensor, the servo (which will be connected to the lock) turns 180 degrees and unlocks the door or secret compartment. I added LED's for extra flair. When in the locked position the red LED will be on and when in unlocked position, the green LED will be on.
